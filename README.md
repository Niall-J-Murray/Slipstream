<!-- ABOUT THE PROJECT -->
## About The Project

[![Slipstream F1][product-screenshot]](https://slipstreamf1-production.up.railway.app/home)
This is project is designed to showcase my knowledge of the stacks and frameworks listed below.
It will also be used as a base for further development of those stacks, as well as learning and integrating new ones.

As a fan of Formula 1 and fantasy sports, I noticed a lack of a draft pick format fantasy F1 game, so I created one!
The draft pick format means that users teams are all different, instead of the majority of users being able to pick the same players/drivers.
This game is also designed to appeal more to novice fans, and introduces an element of luck to users chances of winning.

The app will continue to evolve, feedback, suggestions and bug reports are welcome.

If your README is long, add a table of contents to make it easy for users to find what they need.

- [Usage](#usage)
- [Credits](#credits)
- [License](#license)

## Installation

What are the steps required to install your project? Provide a step-by-step description of how to get the development environment running.

## Usage

Provide instructions and examples for use. Include screenshots as needed.

To add a screenshot, create an `assets/images` folder in your repository and upload your screenshot to it. Then, using the relative filepath, add it to your README using the following syntax:

    ```md
    ![alt text](assets/images/screenshot.png)
    ```

## Credits

List your collaborators, if any, with links to their GitHub profiles.

If you used any third-party assets that require attribution, list the creators with links to their primary web presence in this section.

If you followed tutorials, include links to those here as well.

## License

The last section of a high-quality README file is the license. This lets other developers know what they can and cannot do with your project. If you need help choosing a license, refer to [https://choosealicense.com/](https://choosealicense.com/).

üèÜ The previous sections are the bare minimum, and your project will ultimately determine the content of this document. You might also want to consider adding the following sections.

## Badges

![badmath](https://img.shields.io/github/languages/top/lernantino/badmath)

Badges aren't necessary, per se, but they demonstrate street cred. Badges let other developers know that you know what you're doing. Check out the badges hosted by [shields.io](https://shields.io/). You may not understand what they all represent now, but you will in time.

## Features

If your project has a lot of features, list them here.
